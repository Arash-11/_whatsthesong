[Whatsthesong](https://whatsthesong.vercel.app/) is a song quiz game where you sign in with your Spotify account, then either challenge yourself and test how well you know your favourite songs (ie the songs you listen to most on Spotify), or have your friends join you and challenge each other with each other's favourite songs.

The tech stack is pretty simple: React, Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Functions, and deployed on Vercel.

There are a lot of improvements that can be made and I'm planning on coming back in the near future to work on this more. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, don't hesitate to open an issue or contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arash11gt).
